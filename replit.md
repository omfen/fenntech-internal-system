# FennTech Pricing System

## Overview

This is a complete full-stack web application for inventory pricing and management built for FennTech. The system processes PDF invoices, extracts pricing information, applies category-based markups, calculates Jamaican Dollar (JMD) pricing with 15% GCT, and generates email reports to management. The application features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend using in-memory storage for development.

**Status: Fully functional and operational** - All core features implemented and tested.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build system, shadcn/ui component library
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Modern React with TypeScript using functional components and hooks
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design tokens and dark mode support

### Backend Architecture
- **API Design**: RESTful Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **File Processing**: Multer for file uploads, pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
- **Email Integration**: Nodemailer for sending pricing reports
- **Storage Strategy**: Implements both memory storage (development) and database storage interfaces

### Database Schema
- **Categories Table**: Stores product categories with markup percentages
- **Pricing Sessions Table**: Stores complete pricing calculations with invoice data, exchange rates, and item details
- **JSON Storage**: Items stored as JSONB for flexible pricing item structure

### Implemented Features

3. **Dynamic Pricing Calculator**: Real-time calculations following the formula: (Item cost Ã— exchange rate) + 15% GCT, then apply markup percentage
4. **Rounding Options**: Round final prices to nearest $100, $1,000, or $10,000 JMD
5. **Pricing History**: Complete tracking and display of all pricing sessions
6. **Email Reports**: Automated email system sending detailed reports to management (omar.fennell@gmail.com)

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:

- **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with HMR and Express API
- **Production**: Builds static frontend assets and serves via Express
- **Database**: Requires PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- **Environment Variables**: Email credentials (GMAIL_USER, GMAIL_PASS) for report functionality

### Build Process
1. Frontend builds to `dist/public` directory
2. Backend transpiles TypeScript to `dist/index.js`
3. Production serves static files and API from single Express server

### Configuration Files
- **Drizzle Config**: Points to shared schema with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Vite Config**: Handles path aliases and Replit-specific plugins
- **TailwindCSS**: Configured for client directory with custom design tokens
